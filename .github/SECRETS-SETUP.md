# 🔐 GitHub Secrets Setup

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline now runs quality checks, builds, and tests without requiring Vercel secrets since Vercel handles deployments automatically.

### No Secrets Required! 🎉

Since Vercel is configured for automatic deployments from your GitHub repository, you don't need to set up any secrets for basic CI/CD functionality.

### What the Pipeline Does:

1. **Quality Assurance**: Runs ESLint and builds the project
2. **Security Scan**: Checks for vulnerabilities with npm audit  
3. **Performance Check**: Runs Lighthouse on pull requests (local server)

### Optional: Advanced Features

If you want to add advanced features later, you might need:
- `SONAR_TOKEN` for SonarCloud code analysis
- Notification webhooks for Slack/Discord
- Database credentials for integration tests

## That's it! 
Your CI/CD works automatically when you push code. Vercel handles all deployments! 🚀
