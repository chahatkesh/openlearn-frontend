# Dashboard Routing Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of dedicated routing for league detail pages within the OpenLearn dashboard. Each league now has its own separate route (`/dashboard/league/:id`) while maintaining the consistent dashboard layout and design.

## Architecture Changes

### Route Structure
```
/dashboard (DashboardLayout)
├── /dashboard (index) → DashboardMainPage
└── /dashboard/league/:id → LeagueDetailPageRoute
```

### Key Components

#### `DashboardLayout.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Layout wrapper for all dashboard pages
- **Features**: Header, sidebar, user profile section
- **Renders**: Child routes via `<Outlet />`

#### `DashboardMainPage.jsx` 
- **Purpose**: Main dashboard content page
- **Features**: Learning progress overview, league cards
- **Navigation**: Links to individual league routes

#### `LeagueDetailPageRoute.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Individual league detail page
- **Features**: League content, progress tracking, assignments
- **URL Pattern**: `/dashboard/league/:id`

## Implementation Details

### Navigation Updates
**Before:**
```jsx
// State-based navigation
const handleLeagueClick = (league) => {
  setSelectedLeague(league);
};
```

**After:**
```jsx
// Router-based navigation
const handleLeagueClick = (league) => {
  navigate(`/dashboard/league/${league.id}`);
};
```

### Layout Extraction
The original `DashboardPage` was split into:
- `DashboardLayout` - Reusable layout structure
- `DashboardMainPage` - Main dashboard content

### Error Handling
League detail pages include:
- Loading states during data fetch
- Error handling for invalid league IDs
- Graceful fallback with navigation back to dashboard

## Benefits

### 1. **Dedicated URLs**
- Each league has a bookmarkable URL
- Direct access via `/dashboard/league/{id}`
- Improved SEO potential

### 2. **Better Navigation**
- Browser back/forward button support
- Shareable league links
- Clean URL structure

### 3. **Modularity**
- Separated concerns between layout and content
- Easier to maintain and test
- Scalable for future dashboard pages

### 4. **User Experience**
- Consistent layout across all dashboard pages
- Faster navigation (no full page reloads)
- Maintains existing UI/UX patterns

## Usage Examples

### Creating League Links
```jsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

<Link to={`/dashboard/league/${leagueId}`}>
  View League Details
</Link>
```

### Programmatic Navigation
```jsx
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate(`/dashboard/league/${leagueId}`);
```

### Back Navigation
```jsx
const handleBack = () => {
  navigate('/dashboard');
};
```

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Original `DashboardPage` preserved as `/dashboard-old`
- All existing API calls and data structures unchanged
- No breaking changes to component interfaces

### Updated Components
1. **App.jsx**: Added nested route structure
2. **LearningProgressSection.jsx**: Updated navigation logic
3. **LeagueDetailPage.jsx**: No changes (maintains `onBack` prop)

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Dashboard loads at `/dashboard`
- [ ] League links navigate to `/dashboard/league/:id`
- [ ] Back button returns to `/dashboard`
- [ ] Browser back/forward navigation works
- [ ] Error handling for invalid league IDs
- [ ] Layout consistency across all pages

### Development Commands
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test specific routes
# Visit: http://localhost:5173/dashboard
# Visit: http://localhost:5173/dashboard/league/123
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Extensions
- Add more dashboard subroutes (assignments, progress, profile)
- Implement breadcrumb navigation
- Add route-based analytics tracking
- Consider lazy loading for league detail pages

### Technical Considerations
- Monitor bundle size with additional routes
- Consider implementing route preloading
- Add route transition animations if needed
